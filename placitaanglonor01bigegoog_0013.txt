great carl, William de Warrena. does, moreover, appear
in Doomsday es holding land in Shernburu. Vol. ii.
p. 167. However, the student is now sufficiently put
upon his caution concerning the case3 and after this,
the editor is quite willing 10 101 the record stand iu his
boolr, as 01010 account of some early case.

The write 01 Tewksbury Abbey, 2 Monasticon, (sl-83
(ed. 1846), are an example of the other class of omitted
cases above referred to. Very few of these, however,
would be 01 special value, even if perfect. 'Ihey are all
fairly represented by other writs here given. Το this
class belong also cases dismissed with a mere statement
of sentence 01 judgment pronounced or executed; as in
the well-known instance of the hanging 01 forty-four
thieves by Ralph Basset, referred to iu the Anglo-Saxon
Chroniele, auae 1124.

But the editor hus endeavoured 10 make a complete
collection of recorda of litigation only3 the book is iu no
sense intended as a Codex Diplomaticur, and all charters
and documents not relating 10 litigation heve been
excluded. Many 01 the extracts from Doomsdey can
hardly, perhaps, be termed “casea’' but all of those
presented illustrate some phase 01 the procedure or sub-
stantive law 01 the period3 and 11110 fect is deemed
sufficient justificatiou for publishing them. In the
Appendix will be found all the 100101 the disputed claime
reported in Doomsday, 00 111 as they bear upon the
history of law or litigatiou. Considerable portions of
two very lengthy cases, together with several write and
reeords of some legal interest, are also given in the

Appendix3 and to these is added, for the purpose 01
ready comparison with writs of the texta selection of ,
writs from Glanvill.
