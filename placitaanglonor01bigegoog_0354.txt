hlr. Freemsn assigna the whole litigation, including the ples given
ante, pp. 16-19, 10 110 time 01 110 surrey, esserting 1101 110
lring's urit (errprc) “ nus sent to 110 commissionem for the very
purpose 01 lixing the entry 10 10 mede iu Doomsdsy.'' ὃ Norman
Conquest, 763 (Orlord ed). But there ere strong grounds for
,doubting this statement.

Itis perseetlycleer from the verinus recorda hera given 1101 there
were two stages 10 this litigation, or rather two distinct litigeticus5
110 first, ns bishop Geoll'rey's urit states, being the trial before him
end his 0000010100, and the second, 00 110 eolrnonledgment 01110
concord shows, being before the commissionem 01 Doomsday. N ow
it may well be inquired why, 11 110 commissionem ordered 110 trial
reported ante, p. 16, 110] should not heve been satisfied with the
return mede by 110 presiding judgc, without an ceknowledgment,
before themselves, 01 110 concord just agreed upon, according to tlris
rien, inopen court. The proceeding would be idle, unless it nus
in 110 usture 01 00 sppeal lronr 110 judgment pronounced by (1001·
100]; and nothing 01 1110 lrind appears.

There are, however, atronger grounds for supposing that the
trial reported near the commenoement 01 1110 1001 rrns distinet
l'rorn 110 sclrnorrledgment 01 110 concord, antedeting it hya con·
sideruble number 01 years. The procedure there employed is the
old procedure 01 110 Anglo·Sexons (which lingered on for 0 very
long period aller the conquest). The record is clear upon 1110
point: it shows the case diuidod in the midst by 0 judgmeut in
the usual Anglo-Saxon manner, not upon the merits 01 110 cause,
but directing the mode 01 producing the proofs. Ante, p. 18,
“Tandem ex precepto,” 10. See also Essnys in rtnglo·Ssxon Len,
p. 24010110 seme effect. And 1110 worthy 01 notice 1101110
lring's urit does not order en inquisition, but is substantislly what
in lster times urus called 0 writ 01 right,-a urit 00 ]01 imperleotly
developed. The litigutlon before the commissionem 01 Doomsdsy‚
on the 011οτ hand, nes under the new procedure by inquisition, 00
10 distinctly stated iu the passage lest quoted from Heming. For
such 0 purpose, 110 king’s urit should hare been like the write
giren aule, pp. m, 33.

Ι1 11 should still be said that 1110 does not show thet the two
trials might not here been continuone, or nearly so, there remeius
another potent fact. The names 01 those presentat 110 later
