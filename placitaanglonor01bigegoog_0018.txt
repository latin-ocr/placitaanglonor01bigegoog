ol the gmwth of the Ante-Norman Germanic law in
England‚ could it have been left to developc itself upon
intercal influences alone, wholly apart from contact from
without, it is impossible to say; but it could not have
resulted in the common law and procedure of the nine·
teenth century.

It is true that the external influcnces which have
affected the English law have been largely, though by
no means wholly, German ; but the most potent by far of
all external Germanic influenoes, the Nomen, had itself
been modided, to a considerable extent, by non-German
or (so to speah) broken-German law. The pure German
law of the Anglo·Saxons received in fact a fatal blow
at the hands of the Normans.

There are plain indicatione that the law of Normandy
Ι was not wholly free from the influenoe ol the semi-Roman
law and civilization of the South of France. The stimu-

had powerfully affected all the Continental German

natione: primitive institutione passed by stcady tran·
sitien into new forms, end new institutione arose by the
side of the old. The Normans in Franco ceased to be

Northmen, and became almost as far separated from the
Anglo·Danes as from the Anglo·Saxons; and the
Norman Conquest became the turning-point in the
history of Germanic institutione in England. German
law, now shaken, tottercd to its fall.

If, however, instead of looking for salient features ol'
German law in the body of the present law of Englnnd,
we pursue the course of the common law baclr through
the centurias, we shall be able to discern more and
more ol tha old Germanic element; and long before wc
