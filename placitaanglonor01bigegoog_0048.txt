However, the record of Doomsday has been thought
ho he a check upon any generalizations founded upon
the state of things existing before the survey.¹ There
are numerous references to “ milites” in Doomsday;
hut the herm is very rarely used as descriptive cf tenure.
Of over a hundred passages carefully examined, in which
“ milites ’' are said to hold lands, there are but two
passages in which there is any clear indication that the
tenure was kniglo service.² And the first of these may
only mean that the land was to furnish a soldier. The
other passage, however, is clear. This fact would seem
ai first conclusive chat knight service was extremely
rare and exceptional,· but the truth is, Doomsday does
not always disclose the terame by which the holders cf
laud were possessed. And the lands of Abingdon furnish
conclusive evidence on this point. vhe Doomsday record,
for example, simply declares that “ Gilberh holds of she
abboh seven hides and a half in Garsinghon ;”⁸ bul the
Abiugdon Chronicle states that Gilberh held this par-
ticular land hy knight service.⁴ The same person is
referred to again· direclly afterwards as holding in
Sueting a hide and a half of ihc ahbot, without mention
of the service 3 bui the chronicis says that he held this
also by knight service.b Anskill who appears as de-

Doomsday as holding a hide of land in Marcham of the
