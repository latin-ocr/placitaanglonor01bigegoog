abbot 3¹ but his holding is by lrnight service, according
to the chronicle. Rainbaldus is merely stated in Dooms·
day to hold of the ubbot one hide in I’ob'enie ς’ but the
chronicle again states that the tenure is knight service.
Doomsday states that Hubert held in Witham five hides of
the abbot :³ the chronicle states that he held them by
knight service. And many more cases to the sameelfect.
Doomsday therefore does not stand in thc way of the
assertion of the wide prevalence of knight service, in
perfect development, in the time of the Conqueror.

'Ihe Anglo-Suxon heriot lived ou beside the Norman
relief (relevamen, relevamentum) for a considerable time,
makinga faint appearance in Doomsday.⁴ The heriot
was in principle the return et death of the outfit given
a man by hislord when the relationship oflord and man
was assumed.⁵ 'Phe relies, however, which superseded it
was a payment by the heir tobis lord, in knightly
equipmenlS, or money,⁶ for the privilege of being in·
vested (raised, relevare) with the estate of his ancestor.
Itis certain that there was for considerable time con-
fusion between the two ideae, as well as in the names;
the hogio-Saron term being employed for the Norman
institution.⁷
