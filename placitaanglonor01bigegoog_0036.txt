to issue no more writs, except write of course, unless

gated six years afterwards under asubmission to the
arbitration of the king of llrance of the differentes be·
tween the king (Henry ΙΙΙ.) and his barons; but their
abrogation appears to have left untouched this particular
clause;⁹ for within thirty years from that time it had
