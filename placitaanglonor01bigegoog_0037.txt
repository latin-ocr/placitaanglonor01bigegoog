XXX lurlronl'curort,

become necessary t'or· Parliament to pass a statute to
authorize the grant of writs without imposing upon
suitors the burden (which was practically prohibitiva) of
secking the same through the council. This statute was
the famous Act of westminster, 2, c. 24, anno 1285,-
the most salutary and far reaching euactment ever
passed iu the history of English procedure. Under it
arose actions on the case ; the clerks in chancery being
authorized to frume new writs wlrenever a meritorious
case was presented “in consimili casu’' to any of the
write already iu existence, but lor which none of those
writs was adequare}

The necessity for the law authoriaing actions on the
case, and the endless train of subtleties reaching down to
the present day, which have so otten resulted in the pcr-
vereiou ol justice, were the natural consequence of de·
priving the king, or rather his chancellor, of the ancient
prerogative ot granting new writs. ll'ithin proper limits,
to guard against abuse, the right to issue writs when-
evera case proper for redress or relief was presented was
salutary, and its continuancc would have saved the
English law from centuries of constant and deserved re-
proach. The Statute of Westminster 2 was only an at·
tempted return to what had existed theoretically‚ if not
practically,' until the middle ol the lssth century‚-to
wit, actions on the case; hut the state of law which

event, the king's power was abridged by legislation, and not by prc-
scription.
