INTRODI'CTION. XV

proving his title, that is, for the peredere of his writ.
ln the same year Matthew de Veruon, p. 142, pays a
hundred measures of wine for the concord ola duel.

In this reign of Henry I., there is an absence in the
cases ol any allusion to the ordeal. It would, how·
ever, be unsafe to rely upon that fact, even if there

were no satisfactory evidence upon the point. A legal
institution so dceply seated would not at once disappcar
without· prohibitiva legislation, of which as yet there ’

was none relating to the ordcal ; nor indeed was there
ever any such legislation in England.¹ But the so·
called Laws of Henry I., a private collection of laws
and cust-oms made just before or at the beginning of the
reign of Henry IL, expressly affirm the continued
existence of the ordeal.² For instanees of the duel about
the same time see the case of The Hordarer of Win-
chester o. Abbot Ingulf, p. 182, aud the case ol Henry
of bissex, p. 210.

The statement just made concaming the time when the
Iraws of Henry I. were collected, shows that the ordeal
was tar from obsoleto at the beginning ol the reign of
Henry ΙΙ. 'Phe Assize of Clareudon shows how firmite
hold was iu criminal cases in 1166;³ and specific cvi-
dence of its actual use about the year 1175 is furnished
in the Exchequer return ο1 Robert de Luci, p. 272, and
in 1177 by the caseof John Senex, p. 227. See also the
case of Gilbert de Plumpton, p. 229, anno 1184, in which

Council in November, 1215. See l stubbs, Ooust. Hiar. 619. The
duel lingered ou. and was only abolished in 1819, though it had long
belone become practically obsoleto.
