In the investigation, several years ago, of the English
forms of action in tort from the time of Bracton, for
the writer’s Leading (lases on Torts, the importance of
acareful study of the litigation‚ aud especially of the
write, of the Norman and sub-Noruran time became very
, manifest; and the determination was then made to
thoroughly explore the records of the age. The first·
fruits of the undertaking are now offered to the student.

The present volume embraces substantially all the
recorded temporal, and a few ecclesiastical, litigatione of
the great period which begins with the Norman Conquest
and ends with the beginning of the reign of Richard I.
A few ceses of the first half of Richard’r reign ere given,
so as to make connexion with the Rotnli Curiae Regis,
which begin with the sixth year of that reign, and thus
to complete the series of English Law Reperts from the
time of the Conquest. vhe volume is not a selection of
cases, but contains allos a temporal nature that are
of valuc in the known legal monuments of the period.
A few cases have, indeed, been omitted; but only be·

cause they were either clearly the spurious records of
later times, or were manifestly incomplete.

Of the first class are the litigatious narrated in the
false Iugulf's Chronicle ol Crowlnnd3 aud the editor
