Matilda, pp. 79, 82, und perhaps in the reign of Henry
11, as in the ease of Robert de belesham a. Abbot Walter,
p. 179. This last ease, however, was un offer of proof
by persons who might hare been called as witnesses.
The use of charterS, however, continued to be a more
general, as it was a more satisfactory, form of proof.

Charters appear, to have always been employed to the

exclusion of the other modes of proof, excepting by
witnesses,¹ when litigante were so fortunate ae to own
them ; at all events there is no indication, in any of the
numerous cases, of theuso of wager of law, or of the
ordeal‚ or duel, when a charter was introduced in evi-
denae,² except when there was doubt as to the genuine·
nese of the charter.³ And ewen then if the judges
found the question of its genuineness difficolt to decide
they sometimes suggested a compromise; as in Abbot
of Buttel v. Alan, p. 245. In case the charter were
rejected as a forgery, the party who offered it would of
course fail, unless he was allowed to fall bach upon the
ordeal or the duel. However, it must be remembered
that upon judgment in any case, not compromised or
confessed, the defeated party could summon the judges
to the duel for false judgment.⁴ In the ease of Robert
Fardene, Appendix C, p. 306, that person offers to prove

¹ “Per cartas suas et per testes suoe.’' P. 27.

² The expression “justo Dei judicio” iu the case of Biehoqulstan
a. Arehbishop Thomas, p. 3, where chartere were produced, ir pra-
bebly not used in any teehnieal sensa. The phrase is often used by
the chroniolers where it could not mean the ordea} or the duel. Sea,
for example, Rog. de Hor. anno 1135; l Twysden's Seript. 614. But
if the ordeal was used in Wuletan υ. Thomas, it was probably because
the charters were nearly worn out,—“ scriptis evidentissimis detritis,
et penitus annihilatis?
