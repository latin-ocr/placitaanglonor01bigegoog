Archbishop Baldwin‚ p. 240, the pope’s legates arc
clothed with a writ against the defendant from the head
of the Church3 but the record states that the legates

cuting the precept.¹

While, however, it is pretty clear that process could
· not be executed against the king in the ordinary course
ol justice, it is certain that the king’s rights were often
brought in question without his consent. Claims were
sometimes set up belone the commissionem of Dooms·
day to lande held by the king, and the claime investigated ;
as in Richard de Surdevul c. 'Phe King, p. 51, in Robert,
the Dispenser, o. The King, p. 57, and in lvo 'lhilbois
o. The King, p. 50.Ξ And in these enses the claimant
was sometimes successful, as in the last-named case.
But no process appears to have issued against the king ;
his intereste being attended to douhtless by the com·
missioners. rllhe king was also frequently vouched to

warrant his g'rauts.³ But of process issued against the
sovereign in the lltlr and lach centurias there is uo
evidence*

'Phe king appears in person among the judgcs in many
of the casca often taking an active part in the trial. In
