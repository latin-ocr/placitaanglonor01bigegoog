advent os the Normans, it became necessary to call sor a
force of soldiery to protect the possessione os the estab-
lislrment. At first the abbot (Adelelm) employed
stipendiaries; but after the disturbances bad been quelled,
and after the great surrey had determined the number
of men that might be required of the abbey for military
service, these stipendiarias were retained and turned into
tenants by knight service, vacant lands being assigned
to thern upon the undertaking of the tenants to answer,
when called upon, for each one's portion ¹

Similar circumstances existing in other plesse, it is
sair to presume that this is not a solitary instance.
Wherever the rich possessione of the oburcb or laity
wore exposed to the depredatione of lawless bands, the
protectior os the military would naturally be sought3 Ι
ond if faithful service was rendered, the soldiers would

be permittcd to become tenants of any vacant land's
when their services were no longer needed aa soldiers.
But the cose does not rest upon presumption. It appears
by Elton's 'l'cnures ol' Kent¹ that the king turned his
dreng tenants⁸ into knights lor the delenoe of the
country, and that archbishop Lanlrano did likewise.⁴
