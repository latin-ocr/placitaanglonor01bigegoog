oi very many elemcuts in it, and not a conspicuous
one. It does not lie upon the suriaco: it must be dili·
gently sought out, if its presence would be discovered.
Indeed, nearly all that was typical of ancient German
law has entirely disappeared. The ordeal, the duel,
compurgation, and wergelds‚·have all gone3 while the
great and essential feature of the right of sels-redress
has so far given way that no statement is more common
in the law-books of to·day than that no one has the
right to take the law into his own handa¹ And what
remains is obscured by the presence oi vastly more ex-

have resulted srom the relation of lord and man among
the Aegio-Saxons, the Roman law, commarca, invention,
art, and a thousand potent influences of modern civili-
zation, have added their vast contributions to the English

law, and made it mainly what it is, pushing far into
the baclrground the ancient German element.² 'Phe
existing law, whether of contracta torts, real property,
equity, or even of crimes, disconnected from intermediate
